This repository chronicles my first steps with git, implementing Vue.js for the first time, Nuxt.js, CSS grids, a whole lot of bad commits, SASS, and more for my **[website](https://jonathanalumbaugh.com)**.

## Todos:

- [x] Deploy on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**
- [x] Refactor with **[Prismic](https://prismic.io/)** as a CMS
- [x] Ditch Bootstrap for pure CSS grids
- [x] Implement @nuxtjs/pwa
- [ ] Refactor with TypeScript

Built with love and **[Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js)**.
