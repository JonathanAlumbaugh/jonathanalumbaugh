# Welcome to the repository for jonathanalumbaugh.com

This repository chronicles the long and arduous process of implementing Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Isotope, CSS grids, SASS, and more on my **[website](https://jonathanalumbaugh.com)**, all while learning how the hell to use git (I still don't know).

----
##Things I've done:

* Moved from pure HTML/CSS to Vue.js!
* Moved from Vue.js to Nuxt.js!
* Made the navbar sticky!
* Ditched Bootstrap.css for pure CSS grids!

----
##Things I will do:

* Replace vue-stick with VueAffix
* Include Fancybox CSS only pages where it's necessary
* Retool home button hiding on small views
* Implement jQuery as a plugin?
* Use only SASS?
* Use webpack imagemin?

Built with love and **[Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js)**.
