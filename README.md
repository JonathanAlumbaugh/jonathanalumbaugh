# Welcome to the repo for my website

This repository chronicles the long and arduous process of implementing Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Isotope, CSS grids, and SASS on my [website](https://jonathanalumbaugh.com), all while learning how the hell to use git (I still don't know).

Things I've done:
-Moved from HTML/CSS to Vue.js
-Moved from Vue.js to Nuxt.js
-Made the navbar sticky!
-Ditched Bootstrap for CSS grids!

Things to do:

Built with love and [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
