    <t>Making patterns is more fun than finding them</t>

    <c name="Patterns"
      location="University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, MA"
      material="Fabric"
      dimension="3x3â€“3x9ft"
      date="2017"></c>

    <tt>These are some of mine. In class, we developed the patterns, dyed fabrics, exposed screens, mixed inks, and printed everything by hand.</tt>

    <img-one name="textile-patterns" category="design" img-number="04"></img-one>
    <img-two name="textile-patterns" category="design" img-number1="06" img-number2="07"></img-two>

    <tt>The very slight lines were difficult to clean once the screen had been exposed. Dye-based ink was used as it could be diluted to reduce clogging the screen, without bleeding.</tt>

    <img-two name="textile-patterns" category="design" img-number1="12" img-number2="13"></img-two>

    <tt>It's not weed. It could be, but it was intended to be Japanese maple leaves. This color combination was printed second to the following combination, but is my favorite. The background is dyed a pthalo blue that carries slight variation, while the maple leaves are metallic ink.</tt>

    <img-one name="textile-patterns" category="design" img-number="01"></img-one>
    <img-two name="textile-patterns" category="design" img-number1="02" img-number2="03"></img-two>

    <tt>Still not weed.</tt>


    <!-- 05 -->
    <img-one name="textile-patterns" category="design" img-number="08"></img-one>
    <img-two name="textile-patterns" category="design" img-number1="09" img-number2="10"></img-two>

    <tt>This is less a pattern than a heavily textured print. Most of the fabric was monoprinted using plastic sheeting, while the circle was blocked out and printed afterwards.</tt>
